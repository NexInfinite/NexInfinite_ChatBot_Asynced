You will need to install asyncio and asynctwitch, If you have PyCharm you need to go to File > Settings > Project > Project interpreter. After this you will need to double click 'pip' and search for asyncio and install it (same for asynctwitch)

If you are not using jetbrains, go into command promp and do 'pip install --asyncio (same for asynctwitch). If this does not work then look it up online.
